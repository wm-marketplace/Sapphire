With our handy tool, you can effortlessly generate themes for your WaveMaker web apps. Not only that, but you can also make dynamic theme changes during runtime, saving you time and effort. It's a simple yet effective way to enhance the look and feel of your web applications.

--------

* Node.js v10.17.x+

You can check if you have Node and npm installed by typing:

If you need to upgrade or install Node, the easiest way is to use an installer for your platform. Download the .msi for Windows or .pkg for Mac from the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/download/).

* Git
You can check if you have Git installed by typing:
<pre>
$ git --version
</pre>
If you don't have Git, grab the installers from the [git](http://git-scm.com/).


Install Grunt & Bower
--------

Once youâ€™ve got Node installed, install the Grunt and Bower:
